## About the app: 
### Prevention is better than a treatment. Since there are a lot of misguided information online, we decided to create a platform where users can obtain Preventive Screening they need based on evidence based information provided by reputable US' health agencies. This application gives custom preventive screening recommendations as well as a list of health coaches in user's state, based on user's age, gender and social history.
